    "# Lab 7: Study Replication: The Impact of Minimum Wage on Employment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to replicate a study conducted by **[Card and Krueger in 1994](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf)** that investigates the relationship between a rise in the minimum wage and employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "[Economic theories](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2015/12/effects-of-minimum-wage-on-employment/) have long suggested that increases in the minimum wage lead to a reduction in employment for at least two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Businesses are less likely to hire** and will rather invest in other resources that are now cheaper because of the wage increase.\n",
    "2. **Higher salaries will induce businesses to raise their prices** to compensate for their greater costs; as prices increase, we expect fewer buyers, which will lead to lower demand and employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These theories have found [mixed support](https://www.nber.org/papers/w12663), but the discussion is still very much open within the policy world, as states discuss the opportunity to raise their minimum wage to help local populations to face increasing living costs. Discussions are currently occurring in **[New Jersey](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/nyregion/nj-minimum-wage.html)** and **[Illinois](https://kmox.radio.com/articles/discussions-underway-raise-illinois-minimum-wage-15hour)** to raise the minimum wage to **$15/hour** ([New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/nyregion/15-minimum-wage-new-york.html?module=inline) has successfully passed this same raise in 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Original Study\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first studies looking at this policy problem was **Card and Krueger’s**. They applied a difference-in-difference design to look at two groups of fast-food restaurants:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fast-food restaurants in **New Jersey** where the minimum wage increased from **$4.25 to $5.05 per hour** (treatment group)\n",
    "- Fast-food restaurants in **Pennsylvania** where the minimum wage did not increase (control group).\n",
    "\n",
    "They collected data before and after the minimum wage was approved. Data used in the study can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/DS4PS/PROG-EVAL-III/blob/master/TEXTBOOK/DATA/DID_Example.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do increases in the minimum wage affect employment?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **An increase in the minimum wage is negatively correlated with employment.**\n"

    "<b>SOLUTION:</b>The choice of research design, particularly a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, critically influences the validity and reliability of conclusions in studies examining the effects of policy changes on economic outcomes. The DiD method allows researchers to control for unobserved factors that might vary over time but not across groups, by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group affected by the policy and a control group that is not. This design is particularly effective in isolating the causal impact of policy changes, such as minimum wage increases, on outcomes like employment levels, by mitigating the effects of confounding variables and reducing bias. However, the reliability of the conclusions drawn from such studies hinges on the assumption that, in the absence of the policy change, the trends in outcomes for the treatment and control groups would have been parallel. Violations of this assumption can lead to erroneous causal inferences. Therefore, a thorough understanding and careful implementation of the DiD methodology are crucial for deriving valid and reliable insights from empirical research on policy impacts.</div>"

    "### Long answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sign\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expected Sign**:\n",
    "    - **Treatment**: We might expect a negative coefficient if being in New Jersey (as opposed to Pennsylvania) negatively impacts the number of employees due to higher labor costs from the minimum wage increase.\n",
    "    - **Post**: Similarly, a negative coefficient might be expected if the introduction of a higher minimum wage generally leads to a reduction in employment.\n",
    "    - **Treatment_Post**: The interaction term's expected sign could go either way, but if the policy effectively increased employment or had a lesser negative impact than expected, a positive sign would be anticipated.\n",
    "- **Actual Sign**:\n",
    "    - The coefficients for both `Treatment` and `Post` are negative, as might be anticipated if the introduction of a minimum wage negatively impacted employment levels. The `Treatment_Post` coefficient is positive, suggesting that the post-treatment effect in New Jersey (the interaction of being in New Jersey after the minimum wage increase) had a positive impact on employment, contrary to the negative impacts of each factor individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Significance**:\n",
    "    - All variables (`Treatment`, `Post`, and `Treatment_Post`) are statistically significant, given their p-values are below the conventional threshold of 0.05.\n",
    "- **T-Statistic**:\n",
    "    - The t-statistics for `Treatment`, `Post`, and `Treatment_Post` are -2.745, -2.015, and 2.397, respectively, indicating that all estimates are significantly different from zero at conventional significance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Size\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effect on Dependent Variable**:\n",
    "    - `Treatment` has a negative effect on employment, reducing the number of employees by about 2.847 units.\n",
    "    - `Post` also has a negative effect, reducing employment by 2.694 units.\n",
    "    - However, the `Treatment_Post` interaction shows a positive effect on employment, increasing it by 3.570 units in New Jersey post-minimum wage introduction compared to Pennsylvania or the period before the wage increase.\n",
    "- **Economic Significance**:\n",
    "    - The economic significance depends on the context, such as the average number of employees per store. The negative impacts of `Treatment` and `Post` suggest that the minimum wage might initially reduce employment, but the positive `Treatment_Post` effect suggests a potential recovery or improvement in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania or the pre-policy scenario. The sizes of these coefficients indicate a measurable impact on employment, though the overall R-squared is low (0.011), suggesting that these factors explain a small portion of the variation in employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the policy's introduction in New Jersey has a negative impact on employment both as a standalone factor and in the immediate aftermath, the positive interaction term suggests a complex dynamic where the negative effects might be mitigated over time or under specific conditions related to the treatment group (New Jersey post-policy introduction). However, the low R-squared value indicates that other variables not included in the model may play a significant role in determining employment levels.</div>"

    "\n",
    "- **Treatment_Post Coefficient**: The diff-in-diff estimator, represented by the `Treatment_Post` coefficient, is 4.1275. This implies that, controlling for opening hours, and the prices of soda and fries, the introduction of a minimum wage in New Jersey increased the number of employees by approximately 4.13 units (employees) in the treatment group relative to the control group.\n",
    "- **R-squared**: The R-squared value increased to 0.088 from the previous model. This indicates that our model, including the control variables for opening hours, soda prices, and fries prices, explains 8.8% of the variability in employment levels, an improvement from the earlier model.\n",

    "### Interpretation Following the SSS Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sign**: \n",
    "   - The positive sign of the `Treatment_Post` coefficient is consistent with the hypothesis that the introduction of a minimum wage had a positive impact on employment in New Jersey fast-food chains, after controlling for other factors.\n",

    "2. **Significance**: \n",

    "   - The effect size of 4.13 employees is economically meaningful, especially in the context of small fast-food establishments. This suggests that the policy change had a tangible impact on employment levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implications of the R-squared Change\n",
    "\n",
    "- The increase in R-squared, while modest, indicates that including control variables such as opening hours, and the prices of soda and fries, enhances our model's explanatory power. It suggests that these factors also influence employment levels and should be considered when analyzing the impact of policy changes on employment.\n",
    "- Despite the improvement, the R-squared value remains relatively low, indicating that other unobserved factors not included in the model may also significantly influence employment. This highlights the importance of considering additional variables and potential confounders in future analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our findings suggest a positive impact of the minimum wage introduction in New Jersey on employment levels in fast-food chains, after controlling for opening hours and product prices. The increased R-squared value underscores the relevance of these control variables to the analysis, though it also points to the need for a broader investigation into other influencing factors.\n",
